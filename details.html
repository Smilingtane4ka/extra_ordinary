                            With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the better understanding of all similar
                            scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.

                                Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
                                superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
                                as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since
                                there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming
                                to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but
                                Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
                            </p>

                                The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you
                                would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty
                                yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so
                                that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length,
                                the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred
                                fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub,
                                not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
                                cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric
                                spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
                                formed at the axis of the cheese.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the
                                paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
                                heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a
                                hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp
                                slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
                                ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more
                                pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient
                                to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity
                                too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
                                subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
                                means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give
                                it compactness and gloss.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
                                splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and
                                hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
                                arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
                                to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat,
                                in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off
                                the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the
                                whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to
                                the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.
                                Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
                                As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
                                somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in
                                stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire
                                morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it
                                downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to
                                free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
